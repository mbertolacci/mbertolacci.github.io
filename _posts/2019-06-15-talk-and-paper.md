Last week I gave a talk about our rainfall work at [MCM2019](https://mcm2019.unsw.edu.au), a fantastic conference on Monte Carlo methods that was held in Sydney, Australia. The conference was awesome and the organisers deserve many kudos for their great work. I came away with lots of great Monte Carlo insights, and many ideas and techniques to try!

The slides from my talk are [available online here](/assets/2019-06-mcm-talk.pdf).

Another great recent win is that our paper on the same topic recently hit the Annals of Applied Statistics, [available here](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aoas/1560758424) (ungated version [here](/assets/bertolaccietal2019.pdf)).
