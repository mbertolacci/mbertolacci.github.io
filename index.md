I am a [postdoc](https://scholars.uow.edu.au/display/michael_bertolacci) at [NIASRA](https://niasra.uow.edu.au/index.html) at the [University of Wollongong](https://uow.edu.au), working with [Andrew Zammit Mangion](https://andrewzm.wordpress.com) on [problems involving spatiotemporal statistics and offshore engineering](https://tide.edu.au/).

Previously, I worked on [spatiotemporal flux inversion for trace gases](https://niasra.uow.edu.au/cei/research/UOW264213.html), and before that I was a PhD student in Computational Statistics at The University of Western Australia, where my supervisors were [Edward Cripps](http://www.web.uwa.edu.au/people/edward.cripps), [John Lau](http://staffhome.ecm.uwa.edu.au/~00066872/) and [Melinda Hodkiewicz](http://www.web.uwa.edu.au/people/melinda.hodkiewicz).

You can read about [my past work and see what I'm working on now]({% link research.md %}).

Sometimes I [write about statistics and programming]({% link posts.md %}).

I put some of my [talks online]({% link talks.md %}).

I've been working as a programmer for some time now and occasionally [publish software online]({% link software.md %}).
