I am a PhD student in Computational Statistics at The University of Western Australia. My supervisors are [Edward Cripps](http://www.web.uwa.edu.au/people/edward.cripps), [John Lau](http://staffhome.ecm.uwa.edu.au/~00066872/) and [Melinda Hodkiewicz](http://www.web.uwa.edu.au/people/melinda.hodkiewicz).

You can read about [my past work and see what I'm working on now]({% link research.md %}).

Sometimes I [write about statistics and programming]({% link posts.md %}).

I've been working as a programmer for some time now and occasionally [publish software online]({% link software.md %}).
