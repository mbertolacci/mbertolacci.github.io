# Current work

I am working on spatiotemporal statistics problems in offshore engineering at the [University of Wollongong](https://uow.edu.au) as part of [TIDE](https://tide.edu.au/). I also work on on [spatiotemporal flux inversion](https://niasra.uow.edu.au/cei/research/UOW264213.html) for trace gases at the [Centre for Environmental Informatics](https://niasra.uow.edu.au/cei/index.html).
